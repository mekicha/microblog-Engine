A flavour microblog engine following the flask mega tutorial by
Miguel Grinberg.
I have gone ahead to make some changes here, including in
using the traditional registration/authorization mechanism
instead of using OpenID for that.
Basically, I am adapting the tutorials to my own need, if I
may say.
Also useful in this quest is the book Explore-Flask by
Robert Picard. The book is available for free online
http://explore-flask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

I hope to add more improvements as I continue to learn
